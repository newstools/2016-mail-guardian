On Tuesday, Gauteng Premier David Makhura made some bright and shiny statements about his province,&nbsp;which might have some Gautengers beaming or frowning in confusion. Here are five points, made in Makhura&#8217;s political report&nbsp;to be tabled at the Gauteng legislature, which he used to show Gauteng is the best province in South Africa.1. We got GDP, what do you have? According to the premier s political report, Gauteng generates 33.9% of South Africa s gross domestic product&nbsp;and 10% of the entire continent s GDP.Along with the province s high contribution to GDP, the premier said the provincial government plans to exceed its target of 500 000 jobs.In the meantime, the people have kweshins.Gauteng generates an astonishing 10% of the total GDP of the entire African continent but jobs DOLOLO&nbsp;...#GPPoliticalReport&mdash; Mtshepos Augustine (@MtsheposOnline) December 6, 20162. Schoolgirls won t have to worry about sanitary pads in 2019 The report states that, by 2019, every schoolgirl in Gauteng will have access to sanitary towels so they no longer have to worry whether they can&nbsp;afford them. Makhura said that 300 000 pads have already been distributed to schoolgirls who come from poor families.But the department of women has promised free pads in 2017. Susan Shabangu, the minister of women in the presidency, made the announcement a few weeks ago.Bhekisisa journalist Pontsho Pilane said the treasury&nbsp;will not remove value added tax (VAT) from sanitary products because it will only affect 1% to&nbsp;6% of those who are most vulnerable.&nbsp;By 2019 all school going girls in Gauteng will have full access to sanitary towels. #GPPoliticalReport&mdash; Kaya FM News (@KayaNews) December 6, 20163.

Gauteng supports small businesses The report states that the province spent more than R6.8-billion on goods and services from 1 600 providers based in townships. Municipalities spent R4.6-billion on goods and services from township businesses in the 2015-2016 year. Do you hear that, Western Cape?We are committed to spend 30% of our goods and services budget on procuring from township suppliers #GPPoliticalReport pic.twitter.com/u4ppcF4Ae2&mdash; GautengGov (@GautengProvince) December 6, 20165. R385-million saved from wasteful expenditure Although the province says it hasn t received a 100% clean audit, it has saved R385-million in wasteful expenditure. But is why is wasteful expenditure still a thing?We are pleased to announce, during the 2015/16 financial year we saved R385 million in fruitless and wasteful expenditure #GPPoliticalReport&mdash; GautengGov (@GautengProvince) December 6, 2016
