A private security guard at the University of Zululand is recovering in hospital after he was struck on the head by a rock thrown by rampaging students on Thursday.Bonginkosi Zungu (below), employed by Blue Ocean Security Services which trades as B.O.S.S Protection, was admitted to the Ngwelezana hospital in Empangeni after sustaining abrasions and a deep gash to the side of the head during the attack.Raz Ali, managing director of the security company, said students marched across the campus yesterday throwing stones at buildings and at the security guards.&#8220;One of the stones that were thrown knocked our guard out momentarily. By the time he woke up, about 20 students jumped on him.&#8221;Ali said he had spoken to Zungu on the phone and that he was fine.&#8220;It&#8217;s an unfortunate incident that occurred in the line of duty. We could not utilise special weapons and tactics and react in a manner which would have antagonised the situation further. We had to retreat because ultimately our aim is to protect and to serve.&#8221;Ali said that they worked within the confines of the law and &#8220;the rules of engagement of crowd control&#8221;.Last Sunday night,&nbsp;six vehicles, including three buses, belonging to the university, were torched resulting in damage that was expected to run into millions of rands.A university staff member said that the vehicles were completely gutted and that it included a brand new 4X4 bakkie that had not yet been registered in the university&#8217;s name.While protest action at other universities across the country have largely centred on student demands for fee-free education, staff at the University of Zululand have been on strike since August 15 protesting over low pay, among other things.
