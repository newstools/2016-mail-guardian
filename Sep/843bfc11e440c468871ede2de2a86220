John Coltrane &mdash; Expression: Just this week I had that feeling described by Gil Scott-Heron in Lady Day and John Coltrane. I was deep in the clutches of an existential crisis (still am) but an encounter with the song Ogunde led, naturally, to the discovery of Coltrane s Expression album, recorded in 1967, the year of his passing. I could identify with the candid soul-searching. I forgave myself and, as a result, I walked into work feeling rather giddy the following day. Thank you, St John. (KS)Thandiswa Mazwai &mdash; Belede:&nbsp; Now that it s finally out, I have been listening to Mazwai s jazz rendition of African classics like Malaika, Jikijela and West Wind. Her version of Mamani is heartbreaking, but not as devastating as her Wakrazulwa, which is borrowed from Busi Mhlongo s rendition. There are one or two songs that haven t captured me yet but it s a worthy mood-maker for any weekday. (MB)David Olusoga &mdash; Black and British: I once listened to a Lerato Shadi talk and the interviewer suggested that the triangular shape of the cake in the work Matsogo could, perhaps, represent the triumvirate of forces closing in on Africa: the Old World, the Far East and the so-called Free World. In a sense, David Olusoga s Black and British builds on this idea, elaborating on the confluence of forces that built one of the most unacknowledged yet influential of black diasporas. (KS)Gary Zukav &mdash; The Seat of the Soul: I won t call it a crisis but I m changing, I m recreating my life in ways that deeply satisfy the questions I am always asking of my existence, most notably: Why am I here ? This book is ruining me in the most profound and overwhelming ways. (MB)
