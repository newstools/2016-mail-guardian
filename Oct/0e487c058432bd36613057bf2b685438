Protesting students at the University of Witwatersrand clashed with police after they disrupted classes and tests on Thursday. The protesters apparently took test papers away from students who were sitting for a test. Police used rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Some students were seen gathering test papers that had been torn up by protesting students.
