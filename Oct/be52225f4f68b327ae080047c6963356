Johannesburg s graffiti may come under threat when a review of the city s bylaws and the rules governing the art form is completed.From the pillars under the M1 highway on Henry Nxumalo Street in Newtown to the walls of derelict buildings and high-rise structures, graffiti has gained a life of its own.But Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba believes that it is a deterrent to investment and it needs to be cleaned , possibly by implementing the bylaws that keep Cape Town s graffiti artists in check. The mayor s office said a review of the city s bylaws will start soon, with the aim of improving the ease of doing business and revitalising the inner city.
