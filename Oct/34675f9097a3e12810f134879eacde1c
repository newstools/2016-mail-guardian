Cabinet&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court is in breach of the Constitution, the Democratic Alliance (DA)&nbsp;has argued in court papers.Justice Minister Michael Masutha said on Friday that the government&#8217;s reason for removing itself as a signatory of the Rome Statute was because it conflicted with its obligations to the African Union to grant immunity to its heads of states.In the party&#8217;s founding affidavit to the Constitutional Court, filed on Monday, it argued that the decision to withdraw should be declared unconstitutional and invalid.&#8220;The notice of withdrawal is in breach of section 231 of the Constitution, as it was delivered without first securing a resolution of Parliament authorising withdrawal from the Rome Statute,&#8221; the papers said.Parliament also needed to take a decision to repeal the Implementation Act of 2002 before being able to vote on withdrawing from the ICC.Lastly, the notice of withdrawal was also a breach of the state s duty to &#8220;respect, protect, promote and fulfil&#8221; the rights contained in the Bill of Rights, and was also taken irrationally, he said.Regressive decision&nbsp; DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe lamented South Africa&#8217;s &#8220;regressive&#8221; decision, having played a leading role in the development of the ICC.&#8220;It was also the first African country to pass domestic legislation implementing the Rome Statute. South Africa has turned its back on these ideals,&#8221; he said in the court papers.&#8220;It is now, together with war-torn Burundi, one of only two states party to the Rome Statute which has sought to withdraw from it.&#8221;He also said that once SA withdraws from the Rome Statute, the decision cannot be easily undone and would take a number of years to achieve.&#8220;This urgency is compounded by the fact that South Africa s standing in the international community diminishes by the day while the notice of withdrawal remains in effect.&#8221;He said Cabinet&#8217;s decision had been widely condemned by the international community, and had been seen as a betrayal of its leading role in the protection of human rights. &mdash;&nbsp;News24
