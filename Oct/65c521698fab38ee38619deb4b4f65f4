Embarrassed South Africa coach Allister Coetzee is to canvas the country&#8217;s Super Rugby coaches later this month to determine a way forward for the national team in the wake of their record 57-15 loss to New Zealand on Saturday.The Springboks conceded nine tries as they ended their Rugby Championship campaign with a humiliating defeat, their fourth in the southern hemisphere competition this year and largest against the All Blacks.They have also not scored a try since Bryan Habana burst through in the 19th minute of their 41-13 loss to the All Blacks in Christchurch a period of almost four hours.They were restricted to four penalties and two dropgoals by Morne Steyn in their 18-10 win over the Wallabies last week in Pretoria and five Steyn penalties in Durban, where they never looked likely, or capable, of scoring a try.&#8220;We are hurting, to the extent that we feel very embarrassed,&#8221; Coetzee told reporters. &#8220;The players and coaching team will have to a hard look at ourselves and it is only us who can turn it around.&#8221;While Coetzee said the end of season tour to Europe that includes a game against the Barbarians on November 5 and then tests against England, Italy and Wales, will be crucial for a number of his players, he worryingly conceded there were few outside the squad who could improve the team.&#8220;I will have to be patient with the players,&#8221; he said.&#8220;If there are players out there who can strengthen the squad, we will have a look at that, but I can guarantee you that there are not many.&#8220;We will again take and learn from the Rugby Championship and try and use the end of season tour to turn things around.&#8221;Coetzee will meet with the six Super Rugby coaches before the tour and said he will table his plans for the team at the October 19-21 meetings and seek opinion on a way forward.&#8220;I know what we need to fix, but I would also like to know from the other top coaches in the country if they agree that these are the skill-sets that we are lacking and need to improve on,&#8221; he said.South Africa pushed the All Blacks at last year&#8217;s Rugby World Cup before losing 20-18 in the semi-final, though the world champions&#8217; 2016 side had gone up a notch.A visibly frustrated Coetzee sent a veiled warning to his players the time has come to shape up or ship out if they wanted to get to a point to challenge them again.&#8220;The end of season tour is massively important,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We have taken a few steps back and the end of year tour will determine whether we are going forward as a group of players.&#8221;
