Newly unearthed video and audio from 2005 published by the&nbsp;Washington Post and NBC News on Friday shows Donald Trump talking about women in terms hinting at sexual assault and can only be&nbsp;described as disturbing.In the recording, Trump is speaking to Billy Bush, the then host of Access Hollywood&nbsp;who now co-hosts the Today&nbsp;show, while travelling on the show s tour-bus to the set of the popular soap opera Days of our Lives where Trump was taping an appearance.During the taped conversation, Trump talks about the ease of seducing women because of fame, saying, &#8220;When you re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.&#8221; Trump boasts that when he s attracted to women, he just starts kissing them. &#8220;I don t even wait,&#8221; he says.Trump also talked about his attempts at courting of a particular married woman.&#8220;I did try and fuck her. She was married,&#8221; Trumps says on the tape. &#8220;I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn t get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she s now got the big phony tits and everything. She s totally changed her look.&#8221;Trump was newly-married to his current wife, Melania, at the time of the recording.Shortly after the video was published, Bush&mdash;who can be heard in the video agreeing and trading quips with Trump&mdash;saw his Facebook page inundated with angry messages.Mr Trump later issued an apology: &#8220;I said it. I was wrong, I apologise. I pledge to be a better man.&#8221;&nbsp;In a filmed statement on his Facebook page, he added that the videotape was a &#8220;distraction&#8221; from more important political issues and somehow managed to deflect using Bill Clinton as a scapegoat.Earlier on Friday, when the video first emerged, he had dismissed it as &#8220;locker room banter&#8221; and added, &#8220;Bill Clinton has said far worse to me&#8221;. In a statement posted on his website, Trump said: &#8220;This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course not even close.&#8221; He also said, &#8220;I apologize if anyone was offended.&#8221;Here is my statement. pic.twitter.com/WAZiGoQqMQ&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2016This isn&#8217;t the first nor will it be the last time Trump makes demeaning remarks about women. He has publicly called women pigs and slobs, bullied them for their appearance, and implied that he sees them only as sexual objects. The Republican presidential candidate has also had&nbsp;rape allegations levelled against him. Although Trump s defiantly overt misogyny and womanising reputation is well known and in some pockets celebrated, maybe this time, he&#8217;s gone too far.
