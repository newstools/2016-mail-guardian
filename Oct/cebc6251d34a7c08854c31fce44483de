A grasp of Africa in modern times that is neither utopian nor fatalist , as one commentator has it, is by no means an easy undertaking in today s world of complexity-stripping, shopping-trolley approaches to development &ndash; in which policy-makers freely pick and choose theories that rationalise existing political priorities to act, or to do nothing , and in which often what passes as knowledge is little more than the opinion , prejudices and delusions of the wealthy and powerful who influence mainstream opinion. On the flip side, though, the history of progressive ideas related to development indicates that these ideas originate where individuals and institutions position themselves outside mainstream schools of thought. This spirit of transgression has inspired the contributors to spotlight the ceaseless making, unmaking and remaking of state, governance and development in Africa.
