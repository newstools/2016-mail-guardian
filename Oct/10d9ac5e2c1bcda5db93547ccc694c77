It is the height of irony indeed. The elements of the ruling tripartite alliance, especially those within the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) who defeated what they call the 1996 class Project in Polokwane in 2007 and installed President Jacob Zuma, now need a member of that class project , finance minister Pravin Gordhan, to serve as a bulwark against the Zuma tsunami they unleashed at Polokwane and fuelled with fresh momentum at Mangaung in 2012. The looming prosecution of Pravin Gordhan, should it result in him being charged and discharged from Cabinet, will hurt deeply for a man who has given himself utterly to the cause of democracy. Gordhan is on record as stating that the 27 questions sent to him by the Hawks ahead of delivering the budget earlier this year, after which he was told he was not a suspect, were designed to take his eye off the ball in preparing the budget.
