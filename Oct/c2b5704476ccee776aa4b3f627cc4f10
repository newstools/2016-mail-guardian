Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan must fully co-operate with the NPA in order to bring the matter to finality as soon as possible, the African National Congress said in a statement on Tuesday. The party noted NPA boss Shaun Abrahams’ announcement that he had decided to issue summonses to Gordhan, former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and former deputy Sars commissioner Ivan Pillay for fraud. “This investigation and related, untested and mischievous ‘conspiracy theories’ has had a detrimental effect on the South African economy and we trust that today’s announcement will move us a step closer to uncovering the truth from facts and bring this matter to finality,” the ANC said. The charge relates to a pay-out made to Pillay when he took early retirement from his role at the revenue of service. The ruling party said it welcomed comments made by Abrahams during his media briefing that there was no political interference in the prosecutorial process, and asks for all involved to abide by the legal process. “The ANC urges all parties, as well as external stakeholders, to allow the law to take its course.” It closed off its statement by expressing confidence in the country’s judiciary to act as final arbiters in these matters, asking for those interested in the matter to stop making public comments which, it said, not only undermined the legal process, but also caused a lot of confusion. - News24
