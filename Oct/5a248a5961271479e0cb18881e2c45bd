President Jacob Zuma survived a no-confidence vote on Thursday, after the public protector called in the State of Capture&nbsp;report for a judicial inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in the government.The scandal highlighted in the report has rattled investors and raised the risk of the economy&#8217;s credit ratings being downgraded.Zuma (74) had the support of the AN, which controls about two-thirds of the 400-member National Assembly. He has already survived a no-confidence motion and an impeachment vote this year, related to other scandals.&#8220;I think the nos have it,&#8221; deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli ruled, after ANC MPs&nbsp;voted against the motion and burst into song in support of Zuma.The Democratic Alliance (DA), which called the no-confidence motion against Zuma over what it described as his &#8220;reckless leadership&#8221;, asked for a re-count of the vote.Zuma, who was not in the National Assembly, won with 214 MPs voting against the motion, while 126 voted in favour and one abstained, a result that mirrored his victory in March.In his speech supporting the motion, DA leader Mmusi Maimane urged MPs to &#8220;stand up against state capture,&#8221; while Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said the motion was &#8220;ill-conceived and bound to fail&#8221;.The vote comes after the public protector called for a judicial inquiry into allegations of corruption in Zuma&#8217;s government in a report released last week.Zuma denies allegations that he granted undue influence to the Gupta family of business tycoons, who run a business empire from media to mining, or anyone else. The Guptas have also denied any wrongdoing. - Reuters
