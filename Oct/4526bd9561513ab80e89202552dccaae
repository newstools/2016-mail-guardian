ANC parliamentary chief whip Jackson Mthembu has on Sunday urged the party&#8217;s top leaders, including President Jacob Zuma, to quit, saying fraud charges against finance minister Pravin Gordhan reflected an abuse of power to settle political scores within the party.&nbsp; The senior party member&#8217;s comments come a week after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa publicly expressed support for Gordhan, saying the case against him should not be allowed to undermine his efforts to revive the economy. Prosecutors have ordered Gordhan to appear in court on November 2, in what his supporters and analysts say is an attempt to muzzle the Treasury over its criticism of the undue political influence exerted by the wealthy Gupta family, close friends with Zuma. &#8220;In my view, a minister is being pursued for political reasons, and then charged with fraud. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve then said, perhaps we are not the leadership that can take the ANC forward under these conditions,&#8221; Mthembu said on Enca television. &#8220;President Jacob Zuma is the president of the ANC. When I said the entire ANC leadership that has already taken collective responsibility must take the fall, I meant everybody, myself included, including president Zuma,&#8221; he said. South African media has reported growing rifts within the African National Congress since it suffered its worst electoral performance in August. Unemployment, economic stagnation and scandals around Zuma led voters to punish the ANC in the local government vote, changing the outlook for national elections in 2019. Publicly, Gordhan has said that he still enjoys a good relationship with Zuma, and that he is hard at work preparing a budget policy speech to be delivered next week. But investors fear his prosecution on charges of committing fraud while running the tax agency could see Gordhan removed as finance minister, opening South Africa to possibly losing its investment-grade credit rating.
