A total of 79 MPs voted against it, while one MP abstained. Only the Democratic Alliance opposed her nomination and accused her of being a spy on the State Security Agency’s payroll. Zuma thanked outgoing public protector Thuli Madonsela.. He is expected to meet Madonsela later today to answer her questions about the Gupta family’s alleged influence on Cabinet decisions. Madonsela started her probe into allegations of “state capture” in March, after the Catholic Dominican Order asked her to investigate. Her questions will specifically be about allegations that the Gupta family offered Cabinet jobs and Zuma’s close relationship with the Guptas. She hopes to conclude her preliminary report before leaving office on October 14. She had said she was in a race against time. –  News24
