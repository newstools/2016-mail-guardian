This year has taught me that love is a skill that is lost to many of us because, among other things, we prioritise romantic love and are taught to let instinct guide us in it a farcical notion propelled by centuries of consuming popular Romantic literature and decades of Hollywood narratives about love at first sight with very few movies dealing with what actually happens after you ve found love.
