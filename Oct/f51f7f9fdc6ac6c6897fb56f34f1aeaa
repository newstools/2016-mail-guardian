The ANC said on Friday it supported the release of the state capture report into claims of political interference by the Gupta family, despite a court bid by President Jacob Zuma to block the report. Public protector Thuli Madonsela was expected to reveal the findings on Friday, her last day in office, and she called a news conference for later in the day after publishing a list of 23 cases on which she would report. The list did not mention the Guptas, a wealthy Indian-born family at the centre of the investigation into whether top political decisions, including cabinet appointments, have been unduly influenced. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told eNCA the party was in favour of Madonsela releasing her findings, including information on the Guptas. Both the family, which has wide-ranging business interests in South Africa, and the president have denied any wrongdoing. The claims of undue influence have become known as “state capture”. “From our point of view, we are looking forward to the report because the allegations of corporate state capture are very serious,” Kodwa told the broadcaster in an interview. “... For us whether it is today, or any other day, we are looking forward to the release of the report.” Kodwa said he was not surprised that Zuma had sought a court order to block the report, as that was his right. Zuma applied for that order on Thursday on the grounds that he had not had the chance to question witnesses and review any evidence that implicated him. The case is due to be heard on Tuesday.
