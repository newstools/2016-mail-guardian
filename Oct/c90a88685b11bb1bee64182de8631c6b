The&nbsp;LagosPhoto Festival is themed Ritual and Performance: Inherent Risk. The risk is the courage the subject and photographer must find for the act of posing to morph into an idea or identity, according to the curators statement. The curators are African Arts Foundation (AAF) founder Azu Nwagbogu, documentary photographer and artist Cristina de Middel and Maria Pia Bernardoni, who say the exhibition is pluralistic in its outlook, driven by its curatorial statement that the grandiose result of the photographic enterprise is to give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads as an anthology of images . The festival includes 39 photographers and two performance artists. There are also film screenings, workshops and discussions, artist presentations and outdoor displays throughout the city.
