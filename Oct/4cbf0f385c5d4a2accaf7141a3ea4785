The student demands emphasise decolonisation, free education and respect for workers. Read the full letter below.19 October 2016Dear Mr Mahlangu,We are a collection of South African students studying at universities abroad, South African citizens living and working in the USA and non-South Africans wanting to show solidarity with the students in South Africa.Since 2015, our sisters, brothers, family members and friends have been engaged in a protracted call for free decolonised education.We stand in solidarity with protesting students and workers because we believe that their struggles are just and righteous and their demands are both possible and necessary.We wish to condemn the militarisation of university campuses and persecution of protesters including the gratuitous violence of private security and police who have been responsible for attacking students and workers with rubber bullets, water cannons and other often lethal forms of crowd control.We also condemn the arrest of protesters and the suspension and expulsion of students from the university.In line with the movements demands, we call for free decolonised education now. This means that:1) All primary, secondary and tertiary education is paid for by the state through taxation on the rich. Higher education plays a crucial role in achieving a just and egalitarian society. University fees are exclusionary and perpetuate the extreme economic and social inequalities that continue to be present in South Africa. #FeesMustFall is a movement that demands fee-free education as an essential a building block to a better society.2) The university is transformed from a colonial and capitalist institution into an educational space that is liberatory and foregrounds struggles against racism, patriarchy and capitalism. It would go well beyond the removal of colonial symbols of oppression to provide a curriculum that is centred on the work of Blacks, workers, women, LGBTI+ and others who have been consistently marginalised from the educational canon.3) The structure of the university is democratised so that all students and workers (including faculty) have a say over the running of the university especially the running of the classroom.4) Workers are treated with dignity and respect. This not only means that outsourcing is banned and that they receive a living wage, but also that workers are embraced socially and intellectually as members of the university community.5) Police and other forms of social control are banned from university campuses.We endorse the demands made by the protesting students, staff and workers. Power concedes nothing without demand and the students and workers are making their demands heard - loud and clear. It is time that you and your colleagues in government listen and act.#FreeEducation#FeesMustFall#OutsourcingMustFall#DecoloniseEducationA luta continua!Signatories of South Africans living abroad:Abigail Ramakoaba (City University of London)Nadia Jardine (Wheaton College, MA)Zanokuhle NkosiSibonelo Shezi (Richland College, TX)Mofana Morojele (New York Film Academy, NY)Ntombikayise Khambule (Fashion Institute of Technology Italy)Maya Schkolne (SOAS University of London)Tshidiso Ramogale (Harvard Law School, MA)Bonita Bennet (Columbia University, NY)Zandi Sherman (Rutgers University, NJ)Setsoakae Thipe (Simmons College, MA)Vukosi NkunaBrett DavidsonPercy Mdunge (Stony Brook University, NY)Robin ScherDmitri HoltzmanJared Sacks (Columbia University, NY)Kayum Ahmed (Columbia University, NY)Laura Phillips (New York University, NY)Saarah Jappie (Princeton University (NJ)Dubian AdeCiaran HeywoodJessica Myhill (New York Film Academy, NY)Caitlin Fleming (New School, NY)Gaby Georgeson (New York Film Academy, NY)Esther McFarlane (Columbia University, NY)Other signatories acting in solidarity:Prof. Lewis Gordon (University of Connecticut, CT)Prof. Drucilla Cornell (Rutgers University, NJ)Dr. Jinny Prais (Institute of African Studies, Columbia University)Dr. Firoze ManjiDr. Kathleen Griffiths (CUNY Graduate School, NY)Basma Radwan (Columbia University)Shaunna Rodriques (Columbia University)Prashant Iyengar (Columbia University)Sitharthan Sriharan (Columbia University)Bandar Alsaeed (Coumbia University)Shachaf Polakow (Open University, Israel)Alexandra Fitzgerald (Harvard Law School, MA)Rinae MudzananiMo SchmidtRobert Ascherman (CUNY, NY)Henry Broege (CUNY, NY)Chloe RockartsJames Rosenstein (CUNY, NY)Robert Tiburzi (CUNY, NY)Emily SandersonMathew Ghattas (Wheaton College, MA)Akrofi Akotiah (Wheaton College, MA)Tony Karera (Wheaton College, MA)Sohier Mobin (Wheaton College, MA)Nora Callahan (CUNY, NY)Barrie ClineAlexander ShawBawn Beswick (Birkbeck, University of London)Jeanne HefezSue HeywoodNoura Kiridly (The New School, NY)Paddy O HalloranAnthony Duff (Wheaton College, MA)Mbali TyoloNicole BrownBogosi MorojeleKeshin VitteeThobeka NdlelaDimakatso MokgoshiHunter NestadtKgomotso LetebeleBey ThengaNatalie JaynesNatalie Schall (Bryn Mawr College, PA)Mohamed Wajdi Ben Hammed (Columbia University, NY)Dominic Walker (Columbia University, NY)Amelia Herbert (Columbia University, NY)Andy PollackBrittany HerickJamila Headley&nbsp;
