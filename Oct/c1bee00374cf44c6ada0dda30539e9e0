Khwezi, the woman who alleged that President Jacob Zuma raped her in 2005 has died, her family confirmed in a statement on Sunday. The family said: It is with our deepest sorrow that the Kuzwayo family announces the passing of our daughter Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo. Kuzwayo, known to South Africans as “Khwezi” to protect her identity after multiple threats and insults, said Zuma had raped her in 2006 before he became president. The activist grew up around Zuma, who had spent about 10 years in Robben Island prison with her father, a member of the ANC. “It is with our deepest sorrow that the Kuzwayo family announces the passing of our daughter Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo,” Fezekile’s mother Beauty Sibongile Kuzwayo said in a statement on Sunday without giving details on the cause of her death. Zuma was acquitted in the case, keeping alive his hopes of becoming president, which he did in 2009. Zuma pleaded not guilty to raping “Khwezi”, but his lawyers said he did have consensual sex with the then 31-year-old woman. Her family has described her as a “loving soul”. There will be a private family funeral and a public memorial service. Bunie Matlanyane Sexwale said that Mama Beauty Khuzwayo was not available for interviews. “She is not available at this time.
We do confirm that the statement doing the rounds is authentic,” she said. Zuma was found not guilty of the charge of raping her. -  News24
