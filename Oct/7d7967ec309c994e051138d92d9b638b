 I have been searching for my parents all my life. I was abandoned by my parents in the hospital I was born in &mdash; the rural hospital in Nkayi in Zimbabwe. I was born part of a triplet, but they left me and took my two brothers. I think they abandoned me because I was born intersex, because I was the only one they left behind. It s been 39 years now, but I m still trying very hard to find them, because I don t have a family. I grew up in an orphanage, where they just assumed I was a girl so they gave me a girl s name, Thandiwe. But I identify as a man, especially because I don t have any breasts. Growing up here was very hard. The other children were always laughing at me. So, going to school, I had very few friends. I lived at the orphanage until I was 17 years old. I went to college, where I studied electronics and sound engineering. I have a partner. We ve been together for almost 12 years now &mdash; but it was very hard for me to open up to her at first. In fact, I could be intimate with her only after fours years together. But now I am happy I allowed myself to open up to her. She really understands me. She s my everything. She brought me love I never had before. Being intersex can be very lonely. I wish I could tell all other intersex people that they are not alone; that there are many of us out there. I also just wish more people would understand that we, as intersex people, are human beings real human beings. &mdash;Malume Ngwenya, activist with Intersex Advocacy of Zimbabwe, as told to Carl Collison, the Other Foundation s Rainbow Fellow at the Mail &amp; Guardian
