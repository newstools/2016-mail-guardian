The ANC’s Youth League Chairperson, Collen Maine on Saturday issued a call to arms for uMkhonto we Sizwe veterans to defend President Jacob Zuma. uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) treasurer-general and local government minister Des van Rooyen Des, also attempted to halt former public protector Thuli Madonsela, from releasing her draft report on her investigation into state capture following the interdict President Jacob Zuma sent to Madonsela earlier on Thursday. Speaking at a ‘Hands Off Zuma’ march in Durban, Maine said, “Comrades from Umkhonto we Sizwe, bring your guns.
Now is the time to defend the revolution. We must do it. Generations that came before did it. They sacrificed their lives.” Over 4 000 attended the gathering which was organised  by Ethekwini Region branch of the ANC. The group believes the president is being unfairly targeted.
