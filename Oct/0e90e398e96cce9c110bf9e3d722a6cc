Paul Beatty became the first American author to win the Man Booker Prize with his gag-laden novel titled The Sellout. American authors became eligible for the award in 2014.The 54-year-old Beatty, a writer of three other novels namely The White Boy Shuffle, Tuff and Slumberland, spent five years working on the novel, which the New York Times called a &#8220;metaphorical, multicultural pot almost too hot to touch&#8221;.Beatty received 50 000 in prize money, a bound edition of his book and a further 2 500 for being shortlisted. Beatty s book tells the story of a young black man who tries to reinstate slavery and racial segregation in a suburb of Los Angeles.Amanda Foreman, 2016 chair of judges, said:&nbsp; The Sellout&nbsp;is a novel for our times.&nbsp;&#8220;A tirelessly inventive modern satire, its humour disguises a radical seriousness. Paul Beatty slays sacred cows with abandon and takes aim at racial and political taboos with wit, verve and a snarl. Beatty told the BBC that &#8220;it&#8217;s nice to know that something I&#8217;ve worked on for the last five years, if not more, has touched people, not only in the States but in the UK. That&#8217;s incredible&#8221;.The Sellout beat five other novels, including Madeleine Thien&#8217;s Do Not Say We Have Nothing, the bookies&#8217; favourite, and Graeme Macrae Burnet&#8217;s Scottish crime thriller His Bloody Project.&nbsp;At the awards ceremony, Foreman said they had taken about four hours to reach their unanimous decision. She said The Sellout was &#8220;a novel for our times&#8221; that contained &#8220;an absolutely savage wit&#8221; reminiscent of Jonathan Swift or Mark Twain.&nbsp;The novel is narrated by Bonbon - a resident of the fictional &#8220;agrarian ghetto&#8221; of Dickens on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles, which has been removed from the map to save California from embarrassment.&nbsp;Bonbon is on trial in the Supreme Court for attempting to re-institute slavery and segregation in the local high school as a means of bringing about civic order.Beatty was born in Los Angeles and currently lives in New York.
