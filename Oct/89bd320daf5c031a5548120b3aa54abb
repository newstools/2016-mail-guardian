Returning the “state capture” report to the public protector’s office makes no sense, the Democratic Alliance (DA) said on Monday. The report was “kept under lock and key” in Parliament from Friday and was due to be sent back to the public protector’s office on Monday. DA leader Mmusi Maimane called for the full letter sent by former public protector Thuli Madonsela to be tabled in Parliament. The party has written to the speaker of Parliament to demand the tabling of the letter. Madonsela on Friday told reporters that she had sent the report to Parliament for safekeeping. At no point, Maimane said on Monday, did she say the report must be returned to her successor. “The DA finds this puzzling and contradictory to the statements made by Advocate Madonsela at the time. “In fact, Advocate Madonsela declared that the report is final and not subject to any further amendments. Returning a report that is already finished and signed-off by the office of the public protector simply doesn’t make any sense.” Tabling the full letter would allow MPs to make sure that Madonsela’s request was fully adhered to. “This is vital for the proper and effective functioning of the institution.
We desperately require a working Parliament which acts as the apex of accountability.” The letter should be made public without delay, the DA said. Parliament on Monday said the report would be delivered to new public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, who officially started her job on Monday. - News24
