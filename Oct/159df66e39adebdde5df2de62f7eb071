Read the NAbrahams told Parliament s justice committee last week that he was not the one who made the decision to prosecute.No confidence in fair hearing&nbsp; Sections in the NPA Act and Constitution empowered him to review a decision to prosecute or not, after consulting the relevant director and after taking representations.These representations could be from the accused, the complainant and other persons or parties the director considered relevant.Malatji said on Gordhan s behalf on Friday: &#8220;The main reason for his decision is that he does not have any confidence in the NDPP&#8217;s ability or willingness to afford him a fair hearing.&nbsp;&#8220;First, we repeatedly asked the NPA to afford the minister an opportunity to make representations to them before they decided whether to prosecute the minister, but they spurned our requests.&#8221;When announcing his decision to charge Gordhan, Abrahams had been clear on his commitment to the prosecution, Malatji said.&#8220;Having now had an opportunity to study the charges against the minister, it is also clear to us that they manifest a resolute and not well-founded determination to prosecute the minister at all costs. Any representations to the NDPP would accordingly be pointless.&#8221; -&nbsp;News24
