The African National Congress Women’s League has described President Jacob Zuma’s rape accuser as a brave woman who was able to stand up and tell her side of the story. The ANCWL sent its condolences to the family of Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo who died on Saturday. The organisation said it had learnt that it should always stand with the victim. ANCWL secretary general Meokgo Matuba told News24: “Many of us have learnt a lesson, part of it is that as women, we should always be united; you uphold the principle.” “She [Khwezi] highlighted that we are not free as women yet; we still have so many challenges. She definitely stood her ground even though at the end she lost her case.
But the important thing is that she was brave and fearless.” The ANCWL faced criticism during Zuma’s rape trial in 2006 – with some women within the organisation demonising her. Most recently the ANCWL was criticised for failing to stand up for four women who held a silent protest while Zuma gave a speech at the IEC’s results centre in August. They were removed from the building by Zuma’s bodyguards. They held up placards that read “10 years later”, “Remember Khwezi”, “I am one in 3 ” and “Khanga” in reference to the trial. Zuma was acquitted of raping the then 31-year old Khwezi, who was HIV positive and a family friend. – News24
