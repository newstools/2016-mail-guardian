THE FIFTH COLUMN &nbsp; Good news for dictators and mass murderers! Now that South Africa is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), tyrants such as Sudan s Omar al-Bashir ( Bashy for short) will no longer have to worry about making a quick escape from those who would stick by South Africa s constitutional requirements and arrest him because the ICC has a warrant out for his arrest. No, Bashy can now enjoy weeks of fun and pleasure in South Africa, doubtless in a penthouse suite at an internationally accredited hotel in Sandton. Bring on the dancing girls!
