Students chased Wits University vice-chancellor Adam Habib from the Holy Trinity church during peace talks on Wednesday afternoon.Habib snuck out of the church in Braamfontein after an outcry from students about his presence there.Student leader Vuyani Pambo said Habib could not form part of any talks, while police were arresting students on campus.Some students shouted that Habib should have been arrested, instead of former Wits SRC leader Mcebo Dlamini.A short while later, students left the church, saying they could not be part of the talks if the&nbsp;university&#8217;s management was present.After the chaos subsided, former Cabinet minister and trade unionist Jay Naidoo&nbsp;told the audience that his generation had betrayed them.&#8220;We have let you down,&#8221;&#8217; he said.Naidoo said the country was not working for poor South Africans, but only for the white elite.&#8220;The progressive intelligence of our country needs to be reorganised. Too many of us have been silent,&#8221; he said.While he was talking, a small group of students in the back of the church disrupted him. There were complaints that the venue was too small. They demanded that the talks be held at Solomon Mahlangu (Senate) House on Wits University s East campus.Those in attendance included Max Sisulu, Nelson Mandela Foundation CEO Sello Hatang, and Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana. -&nbsp;News24
