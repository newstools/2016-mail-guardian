The ANC has called on its youth league president, Collen Maine, to retract a call he made for the Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) military veterans to take up arms in defence of President Jacob Zuma. “His call is reckless and irresponsible,” said ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa. Kodwa said peace in South Africa had come at a price, with the ANC taking a decision to dissolve the MK in 1990. The ANC Youth League leader made a plea to the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) during a pro-Zuma march in eThekwini at the weekend, saying the MKMVA needed to act in order to defend the party and the country’s leader. “Comrades from Umkhonto weSizwe, bring your guns. Now is the time to defend the revolution,” Maine said. However, the ANC, in rejecting the comments made by Maine, said it hoped his remarks were never allowed the space to flourish. “In a democratic South Africa, there is no room for a private army,” said Kodwa. The party also reminded its youth league leader that Zuma was elected through a democratic process, insisting that he still enjoyed overwhelming support from members of the ANC and society. The league, in responding to the criticism, said its president would explain himself to officials in the ANC. “There is an NWC [national working committee meeting] today [Monday].
He [Maine] will meet with officials to reflect on such. If the NWC deems it fit that he be more mindful of his comments, that’s what he will do going forward,” said league spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize. - News24
