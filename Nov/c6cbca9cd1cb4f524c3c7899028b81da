 No. This was the short answer that former public protector Thuli Madonsela gave on Monday night when reporters asked her if she would be willing to go back to the ANC, a party she was once a member of. I was a member of the ANC and I left it in 2007, not because I had any bad feelings but professionally, I felt that I needed to distance myself from any political party and I am still in that space, Madonsela said.She was speaking on the sidelines of the 2016 Mahatma Gandhi Awards at the Durban City Hall, where she received The Second Satyagraha Award for her tremendous contribution during her tenure as public&nbsp;protector.She did, however, say that her services would be available to all political parties. I feel that at this stage, I can assist all political parties if they need my advice or services for free but otherwise, I am taking a holiday for the next 13 months or so. In 2018 she will serve as the chair of social justice at Stellenbosch University.The former public protector has received widespread criticism following the release of the State of Capture report, which investigated allegations of state capture by the controversial Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma s son, Duduzane.During her acceptance speech earlier on Monday evening, she said&#8221;: If there ever was a time for us to be reminded by the life and the message in the life of Mahatma Gandhi, it is today. A time when we are going through a serious turbulent country and world. A time when we are reflecting as humanity regarding what road brought us here and are there alternative roads that we could take towards that world where we can all be happy, there can be friendship and where we can embrace each other regardless of race, gender, disability and sexual orientation.
