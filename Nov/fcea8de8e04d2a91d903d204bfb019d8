South Africa&#8217;s Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa saw his chances of becoming the country&#8217;s next leader increase on Thursday as Cosatu backed him to succeed President Jacob Zuma as head of the ruling party. Zuma is expected to stand down as ANC president at a party conference in December next year, ahead of national elections in 2019 when his tenure as the country&#8217;s president will end.#COSATUCEC has endorsed Cyril #Ramaphosa to take over from Jacob #Zuma as president of the ANC.&mdash; Mail &amp; Guardian (@MG_Reporter) November 24, 2016 The debate over who should follow Zuma has heated up since the ANC suffered its worst local election results in August, exposing party divisions. The ANC&#8217;s dominance of South Africa since apartheid ended in 1994 means it is widely expected to win the 2019 election, making its next leader almost certain to become president. No one has declared an ambition to run but informal positioning is well under way, with the ANC split between backers of Ramaphosa, a former anti-apartheid leader popular with investors, and those who feel he would be too pro-business. So #Cosatu endorses Ramaphosa as next ANC President.The same man who proposed a R3500 minimum wage &amp; orchestrated the Marikana massacre? WOW &mdash; Cathy Bulelwa Mgwayi (@MsCatheee) November 24, 2016 The Congress of South African Trade Unions told reporters it had &#8220;resolved to campaign&#8221; for Ramaphosa ahead of the party conference. Ramaphosa is likely to face strong competition if he does compete, including from Zuma&#8217;s ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, head of the African Union. In the excitement about #Cosatu backing #Ramaphosa for ANC president please remember that Cosatu doesn&#8217;t vote at @MYANC conferences. &mdash; Justice Malala (@justicemalala) November 24, 2016 The National Union of Mineworkers, one of South Africa&#8217;s biggest unions, backed Ramaphosa in September.
