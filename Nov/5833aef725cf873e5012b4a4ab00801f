POLICING I see a few healthy spikes of the Nelson Mandela Bridge from my office window at the journalism school at the University of the Witwatersrand (the mark of a good view in Johannesburg), and during the protests &mdash;particularly on the day of the burning bus, October 10 &mdash; I could peer directly downward into Jorissen Street to judge the standoff.To my left I could see the students building their camp of protest, using a dismantled concrete wastebin as a way of marking their territory, and, to my right, stretching out of my view, I could see the cops: vans, cars, bunches on foot and all heavily armed. The unjust force and incredible violence used by the police during this protest are well documented, but, if you watch the police wander around in their ample numbers, as I could from my office in University Corner, you ll detect immediately a lack of training and command.
