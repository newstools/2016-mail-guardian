Jikijela: Thandiswa Mazwai s newly released remake of Letta Mbulu s song of the same title. She was wise to sip from the infinite cup of Mbulu s offerings in a remake that connects the anti-apartheid resistance struggle with the #FeesMustFall movement by infusing archive audio from #FeesMustFall with Nduduzo Makhathini s piano, Herbie Tsoaeli s bass, Ayanda Sikade s drum and her era-defining voice. The full album Belede is out on November 25. (MB)Various covers and samples and the people who put you on.

(LN)Dave Chappelle (Saturday Night Live): If you haven t seen Dave Chappelle s opening monologue to November 12 s Saturday Night Live, you may have missed perhaps the most important and most immediate artistic response to the impending Donald Trump presidency. Watching it at home, I thought of the stray golliwog I have taken in at my work desk, as a reminder of not only our past but also our immediate present, and the integrity required in dismantling it.
