National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams has been called to brief Parliament on the dropping of charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.This after Abrahams on Monday announced that fraud charges against Gordhan and two former SARS senior officials, Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay, had been dropped.The charges were dropped after Magashula and Pillay made representations to Abrahams.Justice committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga said on Wednesday that they noted the withdrawal of the charges.&#8220;We believe that it would be appropriate for us to receive a briefing on this matter as soon as possible. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) has therefore been invited to brief the Committee on the matter.&#8221;Abrahams is due to brief the committee on Friday.Announcing the dropping of the charges on Monday, Abrahams told the media he had not made the initial decision to prosecute the three.Following the representations by Magashula and Pillay, he had made the decision to withdraw the charges.&#8220;They did not have the requisite intention to act unlawfully. I have decided to overrule the decision to prosecute Mr Magashula, Mr Pillay and Mr Gordhan. I direct the summonses to be withdrawn with immediate effect,&#8221; Abrahams said on Monday. News24
