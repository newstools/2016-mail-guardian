Under Dr Wouter Basson s supervision, Project Coast, apartheid South Africa s chemical and biological warfare programme, mastered the idea of hiding things in plain sight. Fashioning tools of assassination masked as everyday objects, Project Coast s arsenal included poisoned drinks, T-shirts and envelopes, and walking sticks capable of shooting poisoned pellets. Poisoned Pasts: Legacies of the South African Chemical and Biological Programme, on show at the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Johannesburg, is an exhibition highly aware of the failure of words and language to encapsulate the scale and ghastliness of Project Coast. Perhaps in acknowledgement of this, Kathryn Smith, one of its curators, states: Poisoned Pasts is not an expansive exhibition, but it has been designed with a deliberate density and a nonlinear internal logic that does not seek to choreograph connections or overstate juxtapositions .
