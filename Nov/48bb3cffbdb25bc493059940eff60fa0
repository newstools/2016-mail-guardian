Thuli Madonsela s last act as public protector was to future-proof her state capture report probing President Jacob Zuma s ties with the Gupta family amid concerns that her successor might be one of them . ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe said the party s national working committee will meet on Sunday and Monday to discuss Zuma s future and the report. About a week before Madonsela s investigative team was supposed to publish their state capture report on October 14, they realised they were being played by President Zuma s team , an insider said this week. It was almost too late when the public protector s team caught on to the deceit with which Zuma clearly had no intention of answering their questions, despite promises to do so.

Their overzealousness, and the fact that Busisiwe came from an intelligence background, made us suspect she was one of them, another insider said. The public protector s team received word that Zuma s legal advisers were shopping around for an advocate who could launch the urgent interdict to keep the state capture report under lockdown. At the same time, Madonsela s office received official communication pledging Zuma s commitment to answer questions relating to his and his son Duduzane s business dealings with the Gupta family.
