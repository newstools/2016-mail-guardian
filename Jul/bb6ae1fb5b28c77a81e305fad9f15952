On Wednesday, SABC Board member Professor Mbulaheni Maghuve, his legal team and a delegation from the public broadcaster, walked out of the ad hoc Parliamentary committee inquiry into the fitness of SABC members to hold office.&nbsp;The walk-out was in response&nbsp;to documents allegedly not being made available in braille for the SABC&#8217;s lone remaining board member, Maguvhe.The SABC also refused to hand over ten of 15 requested documents to Parliament&#8217;s ad hoc committee looking into the fitness of its board, MPs heard on Wednesday.Ad hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith informed the committee on its first day of work that the broadcaster had only handed over five of the requested documents.The SABC says it was concerned that handing over seven of those documents would &#8220;jeopardise&#8221; its commercial interests, Smith said.Watch below:
