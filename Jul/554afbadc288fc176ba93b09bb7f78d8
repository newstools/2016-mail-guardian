Time Magazine named United States president-elect Donald Trump its person of the year on Wednesday, citing the upheaval in US politics brought about by the New York businessperson&#8217;s election campaign and victory.&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to measure the scale of his disruption,&#8221; Time said in its announcement, noting Trump&#8217;s career as real estate magnate and reality television star before he won the presidency on November 8.The Republican president-elect, who will be sworn in on January 20, ran an unconventional and controversial campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Time noted that views of him were deeply divided.&#8220;For those who believe this is all for the better, Trump&#8217;s victory represents a long-overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class,&#8221; the magazine said.&#8220;For those who see it as for the worse, the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse, a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism, sexism, nativism.&#8221;The magazine said its shortlist for person of the year included Clinton, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and singer Beyonce.&#8220;It&#8217;s a great honour, it means a lot,&#8221; Trump told NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8221; show in an interview shortly after the announcement.But he rejected Time&#8217;s characterisation of the country as fractured. The magazine&#8217;s cover called him the &#8220;president of the divided states of America.&#8221;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t divide them, they&#8217;re divided now,&#8221; he told NBC. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to put it back together.&#8221; He added: &#8220;I think putting &#8216;divided&#8217; is snarky.&#8221;Time makes its annual choice based on the impact a person has on world events, for better or for worse. Last year the magazine chose German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Previous winners have ranged from Mahatma Gandhi to Adolf Hitler.&nbsp;- Reuters
