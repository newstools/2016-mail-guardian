Pok mon Go!&nbsp;is&nbsp;an augmented reality game that launched last week&nbsp;to much fanfare and interest. It&#8217;s based on the now 20 year old&nbsp;Pok mon franchise, and plays out the same narrative as the now ancient Nintendo Gameboy games. Except, now you get to catch the virtual beasts out in the real world around you. The app has broken all records with over 10-million downloads in the first week alone.&nbsp;#PokemonGO has amassed 21 million active users in days.It is now the biggest mobile game in U.S. history. pic.twitter.com/ihpknLYDEm&mdash; Ryan Brown (@Toadsanime) July 13, 2016Pok mon Go is even outdoing &#8216;porn&#8217; on search terms.
